<!-- Introduction-->
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>To get more insight about the applications of these interactions that we get familiar with during this course, we had an guest lecture from <a href="https://nextempire.net/" target="_blank">Next Empire</a>
            </p>
            <h2>Sleepwalk during Artis</h2>

            <p>
                The intended goal of this event and app was to join the Amsterdam Light Festival without disturbing the animals. So rather than bringing the light to the zoo, they bring the night to the zoo for the guests. This is a very creative and unexpected solution to join the Light Festival but more fitting than any other solution. 
</p>  <p>
                The event works by downloading the sleepwalking app from Artis and you get to see the map of the zoo. By installing nfc physical at the locations, you can confirm you've been at a certain location by simply making your phone match up with it. The app is designed in such a way that the dark theme makes sure you do not disturb the animals with any unneeded light. For the rest it uses the location sensor in your phone to help you get to the next location. 
</p> <h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>
                What makes this project clever and fitting in HCI is that rather than being on it’s own, it uses the environment wisely and makes sure the technology is an addition to make the experience  immersive rather than being an experience on it’s own. It emphasises and upgrades the human interaction with technology instead of replacing it. As McLuhan once said ‘’Media is the extension of man” and this embodies it very well. This project works mainly by keeping track of where you are to ensure you passed a location. Giving information about the location and making you feel rewarded by the fact you collect the locations. The well adapted graphics in the dark give you an immersive feeling of a night walk.m
            </p>   <p>
                This project speaks to me cause i’m personally a fan of the night and feeling the graphics give to me. You were encouraged to come in your pajamas and it sounds like a homey atmosphere that they tried to create. The well adapted night theme speaks to me so much that I wish I could do it today!
