<!-- Introduction-->
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The last 2 weeks of the course we had "labweeks", we would work on 1 project for 2 weeks with one of the given topics. At which my project partner Simon picked AR/VR. <br>
                Following is the Results, Concept, Process and Reflection to give you an insight of these labweeks. 
                </p>
                <h2>Result</h2>

                <h2>Concept </h2>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <h3> Weapon of choice</h3>
                <p>Considering we decided to go for AR we did our research regarding which software would be the best for this. After a few beginner guides on different options and a good discussion about Pro's and Con's we settled on Unity. Unity recently added in the AR option in the software itself rather than using external add-ons that enabled this within Unity as it did formerly.
                    Next to that I was eager to make my own 3D Model of the castle, I am fairly familiar with SketchUp it gave a special touch to have our own castle. We also found it a great benefit that this enables us to use the model in any future Portfolio seeing we would have ownership over it.
                </p>
                <h3>Tracing</h3>
                <p> To get started on this we used Vuforia, Vuforia is an add-on that uses their site as database and turns images into trace-ables. It seeks keypoints in picture to trace and gives a star rating on how good traceable the object is. This also became out first hurdle because we initial wanted to make the puzzle less
                    "puzzle-y" by plainly using icons. See picture below for initial on the left with its rating versus our final pick on right with its rating.</p>
