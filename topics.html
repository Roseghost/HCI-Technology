            <p>CPR Training through AR. Specially during these times of a pandemic is nearly impossible to safely practice it. Overall these courses are given in group form and even share the same dummy to learn the practice of CPR. By getting a rent package of CPR course you can safely are distance practice on a rental dummy or a relative to stay safe but still be able to learn and practice CPR.
                Simply put on goggles and see interactive what motions you have to make and where. A teacher can even watch along if the person streams it so they can see if it's done correctly to possibly even give out a certificate.

            <q>Case: <br>
                Can you think of an interactive wearable concept that has not been mentioned in the
lecture based on a smartphone, but without a regular 2D touchscreen or look and
feel? How would you design this fresh, ‘nicer’ way of calling and being called using
wearable tech? How does it work?
